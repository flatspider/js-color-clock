console.log the current time on page load
console.log the current time every second
Display the current time every second
Display the current time, padded with zeros to be exactly two digits long, every second
console.log the percentage of a minute that the current seconds represents (e.g., if 30 seconds have elapsed, console.log 0.5)
Using the percent above, dynamically modify the length of the timer bar
console.log a hexidecimal color that is based on the current second, every second
Dynamically update the background color of the clock using the hexidecimal color
Display the generated color's hex value on hover
Mission Accomplished!

// Acquire the current time. 

// Acquire the current time every second. 

// Modify the clock text to be the actual time.

// Pad the time return with zeros.

// Determine what percentage of a minute has passed. Value / 60 = percentage

// Set the length of the under timer bar to reflect the percentage. Width * percentage

// Get a hexadecimal value for the gradient in the background. 

// Update the hexadecimal each second to read out to the gradient. 

// On hover over the clock, reveal the hexadecimal r g b value.
